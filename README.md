# ðŸ’œ Hyprdots â€“ My Themed Linux Dotfiles (Hyprland, Waybar, Wofi...)

Welcome to my personal dotfiles setup for Linux.  
This configuration is built for a **clean, aesthetic, and efficient workflow** under **Hyprland** on Arch Linux, fully themed in **violet/purple tones** ðŸŸ£.

Everything here is tailored for keyboard-driven productivity and a unified visual experience across my environment.

This config is a work in progress. Feel free to fork, reuse, and adapt it to your workflow!
